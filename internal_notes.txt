- Lowest Common Ancestor
  Well-order property of BST, with unique elements ( given by description ) all value on left sub-tree < value of current node < all value on right sub-tree
  Algorithm:
  Three possible cases:
Case_#1:
Both p and q are smaller than current node, then search left-subtree by recursive
Case_#2:
Both p and q are larger than current node, then search right-subtree by recursive
Case_#3:
Both p and q are not on the same side of current node, then current node must be the Lowest common ancestor of ( p, q )
